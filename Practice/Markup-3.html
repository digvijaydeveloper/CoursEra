    <h1>A few Poems by ogden Nash</h1>
    <h2>The Panther</h2>
    <p>The panther is like a leopard,
        <br>
        Except it hasnn't been peppered.
        <br>
        Shoud you behold a panther crouch,
        <br>
        Prepare to say Ouch.
        <br>
        Better yet, if called by a Panther,
        <br>
        Don't anther.
    </p>
    <h1>Lines in facing Forty</h1>
    <p>I have a bone to pick with fate,
        come here and tell me girly,
